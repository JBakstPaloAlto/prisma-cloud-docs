== Add an AWS Cloud Account on Prisma Cloud
Add an AWS cloud account to Prisma™ Cloud to monitor and analyze your resources deployed on AWS.

Use the following workflow to add your AWS public, AWS China, or AWS GovCloud accounts to Prisma™ Cloud. To add AWS Organizations on Prisma Cloud, see xref:add-aws-organization-to-prisma-cloud.adoc#idafad1015-aa36-473e-8d6a-a526c16d2c4f[Add an AWS Organization to Prisma Cloud].

To onboard your AWS account as type Organization that you had previously onboarded as type Account, see xref:#idd4929ccd-666c-4bbd-9cdf-1faa22ea7d1b[Update an Onboarded AWS Account to AWS Organization].

[.procedure]
. Before you begin.
+
If you would like Prisma Cloud to ingest VPC flow logs and any other integrations, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon S3, or AWS Inspector, you must enable these services on the AWS management console. The Cloud Formation template (CFT) enables the ingestion of configuration data, Amazon S3 flow logs, and AWS CloudTrail logs (audit events) only. VPC flow logs and any other integrations, such as Amazon GuardDuty or AWS Inspector are retrieved only if you previously enabled these services for the AWS account that you are onboarding.
+
Prisma Cloud does not support shared VPCs.

.. Decide whether you want to manually create the roles to authorize permissions for Prisma Cloud.
+
The onboarding flow automates the process of creating the Prisma Cloud role and adding the permissions required to remediate (monitor and/or protect) your AWS account. If you want to create these roles manually instead, see xref:set-up-your-prisma-cloud-role-for-aws-manual.adoc#ide7b46e67-8e1f-400f-b763-48bbe41bbe2c[Set Up the Prisma Cloud Role for AWS—Manual].

.. Create a CloudWatch log group.
+
The CloudWatch log group defines where the log streams are recorded.

... Select menu:Services[CloudWatch > Logs > Create log group].

... Enter a name for the log group and click *Create*.
+
image::aws-onboarding-create-log-group.png[scale=30]

.. Enable flow logs.
+
... Select menu:Services[VPC > Your VPCs].

... Select the VPC to enable flow logs for and select menu:Actions[Create flow log].

... Set the *Filter* to *Accept* or *All*.
+
Setting the filter to *All* enables Prisma Cloud to retrieve accepted and rejected traffic from the flow logs. Setting the filter to *Accept* retrieves Accepted traffic only. If you set the filter to *Reject*, Prisma Cloud will not retrieve any flow log data.

... Verify that the *Destination* is configured to *Send to CloudWatch Logs*.

... Select the *Destination log group* you created above.

... Create a new https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html[IAM Role] or use an existing one to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-cwl.html[publish flow logs] to the CloudWatch log group.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using an existing IAM role to publish logs to the CloudWatch log group, you must edit the IAM role to include the following permissions.

. Select *AWS* as the *Cloud to Secure*.

. Select *Account* for the *Onboard Type*.

. Enter a *Cloud Account Name* and *Account ID*.
+
A cloud account name is auto-populated for you. Replace it with a cloud account name that uniquely identifies your AWS account on Prisma Cloud. A unique account ID is used to enable the trust relationship in the role's trust policy, which you will require later in the onboarding process.
+

Prisma Cloud supports AWS Lambda functions.

* Enable *Agent Based Workload Protection* to provide permissions to deploy image:ext-link-icon-small.png[scale=100] https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/auto_defend_host[Host Defenders] on virtual machines or instances in your AWS cloud account and to deploy the image:ext-link-icon-small.png[scale=100] https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/auto_defend_serverless[Serverless Defender] to the AWS Lambda functions deployed in your cloud account. Prisma Cloud uses the AWS API to deploy the Serverless Defender as a Lambda layer based on the auto-defend rules. This is not enabled by default. 

* xref:../../prisma-cloud-data-security/enable-data-security-module/add-a-new-aws-account.adoc#idee00fe2e-51d4-4d26-b010-69f3c261ad6f[Enable Data Security] to scan your resources to prevent data leaks. This is not enabled by default.

* Enable *Remediation* to address policy violations reported for remediable Configuration policies on Prisma Cloud. This is not enabled by default. When enabled, the Prisma Cloud role gets read-write access permissions to your AWS cloud account to successfully execute the remediation commands. If you choose not to enable remediation, Prisma Cloud will have read-only access permissions to monitor the resources in your AWS cloud account.

. *Next*. 
+
After you sucessfully onboard your AWS account on Prisma Cloud, the account is automatically available in Compute and enabled for Workload Discovery and Serverless function scans. For Agentless scans, you have to complete the configuration to trigger the scan.

. *Create IAM Role* or *Download IAM Role CFT*. Click *here* to follow those steps to generate the *IAM Role ARN*.
+
If you are already logged in to your AWS management console, clicking *Create IAM Role* creates a dynamic link based on the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* you selected that takes you to the *Quick create stack*. The details are uploaded automatically, you do not need to enter them manually in order to create the stack. Make sure you complete the onbaording process within 1 hour, else the link will expire.
+
Once you *Download IAM Role CFT*, it is valid for 30 days. Even after you close the dialog after completing the onboarding process, you can revisit within 30 days to onboard again using the same ID and Role ARN.
+
To automate the process of creating the Prisma Cloud role that is trusted and has the permissions required to retrieve data on your AWS deployment, Prisma Cloud uses a CFT. The CFT enables the ingestion of configuration data, Amazon S3 flow logs, and AWS CloudTrail logs (audit events) only, and it does not support the ability to enable VPC flow logs for your AWS account.
+
+++<draft-comment>Question about: “The CFT enables the ingestion of configuration data and AWS CloudTrail logs (audit events) only, and it does not support the ability to enable VPC flow logs for your AWS account or any other integrations, such as Amazon GuardDuty or AWS Inspector.” Doesn’t this contradict step 1? Perhaps modify to “it supports VPC flow logs and other integrations such as Amazon GuardDuty if you enable these services in your account.”</draft-comment>+++
+

+++<draft-comment>If you do not want to use the CFT to create the role, see xref:set-up-your-prisma-cloud-role-for-aws-manual.adoc#ide7b46e67-8e1f-400f-b763-48bbe41bbe2c[Set Up the Prisma Cloud Role for AWS—Manual] for instructions on creating the role and attaching the policies manually.

. *Next*.

. Review the onboarding *Status* of your AWS account on Prisma Cloud.

. *Save*.
[NOTE]
====
* Prisma Cloud checks whether Compute permissions are enabled only if you have one or more compute workloads deployed on the AWS cloud accounts that are onboarded. The cloud status transitions from green to amber only when you have compute workloads deployed and the additional permissions are not enabled for remediation.
* If you have services that are not enabled on your AWS account, the status screen provides you some details.
* You can enable monitoring of VPC flow logs data to be published to S3 buckets in a Logging Account that you need to onboard. See xref:enable-flow-logs-for-amazon-s3.xml[Configure Flow Logs from Amazon S3].
