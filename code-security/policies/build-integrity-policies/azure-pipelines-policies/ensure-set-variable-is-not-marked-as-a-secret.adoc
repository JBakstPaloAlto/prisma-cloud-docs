== Ensure set variable is not marked as a secret
You can set secret variables in a script with a logging command but this is not recommended since anyone who can access your pipeline will be able to also see the secret.

- bash: |
echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=normal_variable;]something"
-       echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=secret_variable;issecret=true]super-secret"
