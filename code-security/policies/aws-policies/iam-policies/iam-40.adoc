*Description* 


AWS IAM policies control access permissions for each IAM user, role and group created in your AWS account.

Policies that are not-in-use are defined in the following scenarios:

* Excessive user policy: checks if a policy is directly attached to a user and isn't used by that user.
* Excessive role policy: checks if a policy is directly attached to a role and isn't used by that role.

We recommend that you track usage and non-usage of policies to prevent any accidental changes that may lead to future unauthorized access.
