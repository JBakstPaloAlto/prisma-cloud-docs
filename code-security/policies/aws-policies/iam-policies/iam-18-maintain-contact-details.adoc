== AWS account contact details are not up-to-date


*Description* 


Ensure contact email and telephone details for AWS accounts are current and map to more than one individual in your organization.
An AWS account supports a number of contact details, and AWS will use these to contact the account owner if activity judged to be in breach of the *Acceptable Use Policy* or a likely security compromise is observed by the AWS Abuse team.
Contact details should not be for a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual is unavailable.
Email contact details should point to a mail alias which forwards email to multiple individuals within your organization.
If an AWS account is observed to be behaving in a prohibited or suspicious manner, AWS will attempt to contact the account owner by email and phone using the contact details listed.
If this is unsuccessful and the account behavior needs urgent mitigation, proactive measures may be taken, including throttling of traffic between the account exhibiting suspicious behavior and the AWS API endpoints and the Internet.
This will result in impaired service to and from the account in question.
To establish prompt contact, we recommend you set AWS account contact details to point to resources with multiple individuals as recipients, such as email aliases and PABX hunt groups, or other call-forwarding systems.
