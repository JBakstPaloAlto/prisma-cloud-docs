== Unattached policies are not removed


*Description* 


AWS IAM policies control access permissions for each IAM user, role and group created in your AWS account.
An unattached policy is defined as a policy that does not have any principals attached to it.
We recommend that you track usage and non-usage of policies to prevent any accidental changes that may lead to future unauthorized access.
