== Security contact information is not registered


*Description* 


AWS provides customers with the option of specifying the contact information for an account's security team.
Specifying security-specific contact information will help ensure that security advisories sent by AWS reach the team in your organization that is best equipped to respond to them.
We recommended that contact information for an account is provided.
