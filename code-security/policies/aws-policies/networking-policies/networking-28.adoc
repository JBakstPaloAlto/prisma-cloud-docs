== Internet-facing ELBs are not whitelisted


*Description* 


An internet-facing AWS ELB/ALB is a public resource on your network that is completely exposed to the internet.
It has a publicly resolvable DNS name that can accept HTTP(S) requests from clients over the Internet.
External actors gaining knowledge to this information can potentially attempt to access the EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer.
We recommend you review internet-facing load balancers on a regular basis to ensure they are still in-use and configured correctly.
Select an operation-method (internal or internet-facing) for your ELBs and ALBs in accordance with your load balancing architecture needs.
