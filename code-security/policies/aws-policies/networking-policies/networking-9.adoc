== AWS VPC endpoints are exposed


*Description* 


When creating a VPC endpoint, it is set up with the following policy by default:
----
{
"Version": "2008-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": "*",
"Action": "*",
"Resource": "*"
}
]
}
----
This policy allows any resource in the VPC full access to the service behind the endpoint, for example, S3, DynamoDB.
We recommend you limiting this policy and adopting the principle of least privilege access management to reduce the risk of accidental changes and unintended disclosure of highly privileged data.
