*Description* 


ETCD is a distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system.
As a general precaution if any resource needs to be open to the internet, it must first undergo a security review and approval from DSO.

=== Fix - Runtime


*Procedure*

. Allow access to a specific list of IP addresses.

. Once the etcd service is not publicly accessible Bridgecrew will automatically close the issue.

. You can also request exception from the policy violation details page.

. SecOps will review and involve DSO if required and grant exception;
+
Bridgecrew will automatically ignore this resource until the expiry of exception.
