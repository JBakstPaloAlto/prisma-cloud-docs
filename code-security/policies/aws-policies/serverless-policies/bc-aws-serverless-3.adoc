== Lambda function has same IAM role for more than one Lambda function


*Description* 


Ensure that your Amazon Lambda functions do not share the same execution role in order to promote the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) by providing each individual function the minimal amount of access required to perform its tasks.
There should always be a one-to-one relationship between the Lambda functions and their execution roles, meaning that each Lambda function should have its own IAM execution role, therefore this role should not be shared between functions.
