== No serverless Lambda policy modifications detected


*Description* 


CloudTrail captures API calls for AWS Lambda as events.
This includes calls from the AWS Lambda console and code calls to the AWS Lambda API operations.
Tracking changes to Lambda functions helps determine: if the request was made to AWS Lambda, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when the request was made, and additional details.
We recommend tracking Lambda policy modifications, including:
* DeleteFunction
* CreateFunction
* UpdateFunctionCode
