== An unused EBS volume is not attached to an instance


*Description* 


An Amazon EBS volume is a block-level storage device that can be attached to one or more of your instances in the same Availability Zone.
An EBS volume may contain sensitive data which is not in use.
Unused EBS volumes incur extra charges.
Deleting unused EBS volumes helps to control where sensitive data is stored, and reduce your AWS costs.

=== Fix - Runtime


*AWS Console* 


To change the policy using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2 console].

. In the navigation pane, select *Elastic Block Store* > *Volumes*.

. Select an available *Volume*, then select *Actions* > *Attach Volume*.

. Enter the name or ID of the *Instance*;
+
the matching list of instances displays.
+
Only instances in the same Availability Zone as the volume display.
+
Select an *Instance* from the list.

. For *Device*, either keep the suggested *Device Name*, or enter a different supported *Device Name*.
+
For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/device_naming.html[Device naming on Linux Instances].

. Select *Attach*.


*CLI Command* 


To attach a volume to an instance, see the following example:


[source,shell]
----
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "aws ec2 attach-volume
--volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0
--instance-id i-01474ef662b89480
--device /dev/sdf",
      "language": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
----
To delete the unused EBS volume, use the following command:


[source,shell]
----
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "aws
--profile &lt;YOUR_PROFILE> 
--region &lt;YOUR_REGION> ec2 delete-volume 
--volume-id &lt;VOLUME_ID>",
      "language": "shell"
    }
  ]
}

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


The code below demonstrates how to attach a volume to an instance.+++&lt;/VOLUME_ID>++++++&lt;/YOUR_REGION>++++++&lt;/YOUR_PROFILE>+++
* *Resources:* aws_volume_attachment
* *Arguments*: instance_id - (Required) ID of the Instance to attach to volume_id - (Required) ID of the Volume to be attached


[source,go]
----
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "resource "aws_volume_attachment" "ebs_att" {
  ...
+ volume_id   = aws_ebs_volume.example.id
+ instance_id = aws_instance.web.id
}

resource "aws_ebs_volume" "example" {
  ...
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ...
}",
      "language": "go"
    }
  ]
