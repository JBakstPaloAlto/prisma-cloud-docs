== Instances with scheduled reboots are not rescheduled or manually rebooted


*Description* 


AWS periodically schedules system maintenance that requires an EC2 instance to be rebooted or migrated.
These events are scheduled and will occur automatically.
We recommend you reschedule the event at a time convenient to you, or you manually reboot an instance and forego the scheduled event.
EBS-backed instances can safely be rebooted.
Instance reboots at the default scheduled time are likely to cause some type of availability blip, depending on the particular instance.

[WARNING]
====
Stopping or rebooting an instance-store-backed EC2 instance will cause the contents of the volume to be lost. Instance store volumes must be migrated to a new instance prior to being stopped.
====
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html#types-of-scheduled-events[the AWS docs] for a full description of the different types of scheduled maintenance.
