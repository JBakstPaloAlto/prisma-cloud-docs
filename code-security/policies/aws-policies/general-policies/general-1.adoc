== EC2 instances do not have tags


*Description* 


Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.
This is useful when you have many resources of the same type--you can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags that you've assigned to it.
All AWS assets should have at minimum these four mandatory tags: Application, XXX, YYY and ZZZ.
Assets without these mandatory tags will be marked as non-compliant.
An example of the tag value pairs: *Tag name: Application Example value: Rebellion*.

=== Fix - Runtime


*Guidelines To remediate this issue add the mandatory tags to the assets following the Cloud Asset Tagging https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html[guidelines].* 




*CLI Command* 


The following command adds the tag Stack=production to the specified image, or overwrites an existing tag for the AMI where the tag key is Stack.
If the command succeeds, no output is returned.
