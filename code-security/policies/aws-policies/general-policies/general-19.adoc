== Unused Elastic IPs are present


*Description* 


AWS charges for unused or unallocated Elastic IPs as these are a finite resource.
Elastic IPs can sometimes be overlooked when infrastructure is decommissioned.
Its is sub-optimal to pay for a resource you aren't using.
Checking for unused Elastic IPs enables costs to be aligned with usage.

=== Fix - Runtime


*EC2 console* 


Open your AWS console to EC2 for your region e.g.
https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-2#Addresses:

If you have any unallocated Public IPs (They will show no value for *Association ID*), select them and choose "Release Elastic IP address".

*CLI command* 


If you run the AWS cli command: `aws ec2 describe-addresses`
Find all the Elastics IPs that don't have an allocated id and then use:
----
aws ec2 release-address --public-ip &lt;theIPyoudontneed>
----

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


In the unlikely event that you have an unallocated elastic IP in Terraform, then you will need to de-provision it with Terraform destroy:


[source,go]
----
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "resource "aws_eip" "lonely-ip" {}",
      "language": "go"
    }
  ]
}
----


*CloudFormation* 


* *Resources:* "AWS::EC2::EIP" If you have managed to provision an unassociated Elastic IP in Cloudformation, you will need to find the resource that has the type:  "Type" : "AWS::EC2::EIP" and delete that section.
Make sure there is no AWS::EC2::EIPAssociation for that Elastic IP and double check its association before attempting the edit.
