== S3 bucket policy grants Allow permission to everyone


*Description* 


The S3 bucket policy access permission settings are used to define who can access data and objects contained in a bucket.
Users with access to S3 buckets are authorized to read, write, upload and delete objects and data in the bucket.
This level of permission granted to *Everyone* may result in theft of data, compromised privacy, or unintended charges.
S3 buckets used for hosting static websites should be globally accessible to unauthenticated users.
Permission set to** Any AWS Authenticate Users** provides global access.
All other S3 buckets must not allow public access.
We recommend you use Bucket ACL to manage access to data in S3 buckets.
Protect against data theft and undesired intrusion by limiting public access and never granting *Allow* permission to *Everyone*.

*Procedure* 


To review the bucket policy, use the following command:
[,bash]
----
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name
----
To check if the bucket has website hosting configured, use the following command:
[,bash]
----
aws s3api get-bucket-website --bucket your-bucket-name
----
S3 buckets should be protected by using the bucket ACL and bucket policies.
If you want to share data with other users via S3 buckets, you could create pre-signed URLs with a short expiration duration.
To generate a pre-signed URL for the file _samplefile.zip_, use the following command:
[,bash]
----
aws s3 presign --expires-in 36000 s3://sharedfolder/samplefile.zip
----
To generate pre-signed URLS for every object in an S3 bucket, use the following command:
[,bash]
----
aws s3 ls --recursive s3://sharedfolder | awk '{print $4}' |
while read line; do aws s3 presign --expires-in 36000 s3://sharedfolder/$line; done
----

[NOTE]
====
For all automation-related work use the bucket policy to grant access to the required roles.
