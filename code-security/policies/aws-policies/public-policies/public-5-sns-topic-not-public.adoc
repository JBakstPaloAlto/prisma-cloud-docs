== SNS topic policy is publicly accessible


*Description* 


AWS SNS is a hosted topics service that lets you integrate distributed software systems and components.
It provides a generic web services API and it can be accessed by any programming language that the AWS SDK supports.
Public SNS topics potentially expose existing interfaces to unwanted 3rd parties that can tap into an existing data stream, resulting in data leak to an unwanted party.
