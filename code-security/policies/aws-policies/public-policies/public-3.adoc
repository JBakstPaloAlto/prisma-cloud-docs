== Ensure Elasticsearch domains are not publicly accessible


*Description* 


AWS Elasticsearch should not be publicly accessible from the internet.
This is to protect data from unauthorized user access, data loss and possible leakage of sensitive data.

=== Fix - Runtime


*AWS Console* 


To change the policy using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Change the _access control policy_ and _security groups_ to make the _ES endpoint_ *private*.

. Allow only a specific list of *IP addresses*.

. Once the **Elastic Search endpoint **is not publicly accessible, Bridgecrew will automatically close the issue.

. You can request an exception from the *policy violation* details page.

. SecOps will review, involving DSO if required, and grant exception, then Bridgecrew will automatically ignore this resource until the expiry of the exception.
