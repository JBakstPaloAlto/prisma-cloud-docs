== Ensure RDS instances are not publicly accessible


*Description* 


AWS RDS is a managed DB service enabling quick deployment and management of MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server DB engines.
We recommend you encrypt RDS functions as an additional layer of data from unauthorized access to its storage.
RDS native encryption helps protect your applications deployed in the cloud and easily fulfills compliance requirements for data-at-rest encryption.
