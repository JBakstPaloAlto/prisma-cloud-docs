== CloudTrail logging in All Regions is not enabled


*Description* 


You can configure CloudTrail to deliver log files from multiple regions to a single S3 bucket for a single account.
When you change an existing single-region trail to log all regions, CloudTrail logs events from all regions in your account.
Enabling global monitoring for CloudTrail will help you manage your AWS account and maintain the security of a global infrastructure.
Multiple region auditing enables storing log files from all regions in a single S3 bucket and a single CloudWatch Logs group.
It also enables managing all configurations for all regions from one location and recording of API calls in regions that are not used to detect any abnormal activity.
