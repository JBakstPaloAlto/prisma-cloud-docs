== CloudWatch logs are not encrypted at rest using KMS CMKs


*Description* 


AWS CloudWatch Logs is a web service that stores logs from various AWS services, including Lambda function runs and ECS tasks.
AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that helps create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt account data.
It uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of encryption keys.
CloudWatch logs can be configured to leverage server-side encryption (SSE) and KMS customer created master keys (CMK) to further protect log data.
We recommend you configure CloudWatch log groups to use SSE-KMS to provide additional confidentiality controls on log data.
A given user must have S3 read permission on the corresponding log bucket and must be granted decrypt permission by the CMK policy.

=== Fix - Runtime


*AWS Console* 


To configure a CloudWatch Log Group to use SSE-KMS using the Management Console during creation, follow these steps.

[NOTE]
====
In the AWS console, you can only attach a KMS key during log group creation. To attach a key to an existing log group, you must use the AWS CLI.
====

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/[Amazon CloudWatch console].

. In the left navigation pane, click *Log Groups*.

. Click _Create Log Group_.

. Enter the ARN of a KMS key to associate with this log group.

. Fill out the other fields as desired, and click _Create_.
+
Note that the KMS key you associate with a log group must have permissions to be used by the AWS CloudWatch service.
+
Ensure the KMS key's policy has a `Statement` similar to the following example.
+
The console will not allow you to attach a key with an incorrect policy.
