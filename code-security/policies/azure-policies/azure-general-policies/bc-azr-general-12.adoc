== SQL servers audit logs retention period less than 90 days 


*Description* 


Audit Logs can help you find suspicious events, unusual activity, and trends.
Auditing the SQL server, at the server-level, allows you to track all existing and newly created databases on the instance.
This policy identifies SQL servers which do not retain audit logs for more than 90 days.
As a best practice, configure the audit logs retention time period to be greater than 90 days
