*Description* 


Terraform Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together written in HCL (HashiCorp-Language).
A module consists of a collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files kept together in a directory.
Modules are the main way to package and reuse resource configurations with Terraform.
In addition to modules from the local filesystem, Terraform can load modules from a public or private registry.
This makes it possible to publish modules for others to use, and to use modules that others have published.


*Package Managers The Terraform Registry hosts a broad collection of publicly available Terraform modules for configuring many kinds of common infrastructure.* 


These modules are free to use, and Terraform can download them automatically if you specify the appropriate source and version in a module call block.
Also, members of your organization might produce modules specifically crafted for your own infrastructure needs.
Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise both include a private module registry for sharing modules internally within your organization.


*Utilizing Modules Module Blocks documents the syntax for calling a child module from a parent module, including meta-arguments like for_each.* 


Module Sources documents what kinds of paths, addresses, and URIs can be used in the source argument of a module block.
The Meta-Arguments section documents special arguments that can be used with every module, including providers, depends_on, count, and for_each.
Files: `main.tf`
