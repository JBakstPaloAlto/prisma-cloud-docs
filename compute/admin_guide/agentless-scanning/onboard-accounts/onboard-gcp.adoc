== Onboard GCP Accounts

When you click the *Download* button, multiple permission templates are downloaded as JINJA files.
These templates support the various permissions required by each of the cloud accounts for each of the scanning modes.

=== Same Account Mode

To scan accounts using this mode, download and apply the permission template that ends in `_target_user_permissions.yaml.jinja` to the GCP project.

=== Hub Account Mode

You first configure and select an cloud account to serve as the hub account.
You apply permissions templates from the hub account in Prisma Cloud to the hub project in GCP, and apply permissions templates from both the hub account and the target account in Prisma Cloud to the target project in GCP.

==== Hub Account/Project

To use an account as a hub account, first add it to Cloud Accounts, downloading and applying the permission template that ends in `_hub_user_permissions.yaml.jinja` to that hub project in GCP.

To also allow that hub account to scan its own hosts, also apply the permission template that ends in `_target_user_permissions.yaml.jinja` to that hub project in GCP.
Otherwise, disable Agentless scanning for that hub account in Cloud Accounts.

==== Target Account/Project

Download and apply the permission templates that end in `_hub_target_user_permissions.yaml.jinja` and `_hub_target_access_permissions.yaml.jinja` to the target project in GCP.
