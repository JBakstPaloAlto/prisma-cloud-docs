^1^Not applicable: The feature isn't supported in the product for this cloud provider.

By default, Compute feature-specific minimalist permissions are added to all CloudFormation Templates for AWS, Azure and GCP accounts onboarded to Prisma Cloud.
The following two onboarding modes define these permissions: *Monitor* and *Monitor & Protect*.

You can review the   xref:../../configure/permissions.adoc[list of all features and their corresponding permissions].

==== Cloud Account Permission Status

Currently, cloud account status checks don't take Compute permissions into account.
They remain green even if Compute permissions are missing in order to accommodate Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) users who do not use Prisma Cloud Compute functionalities. For them, changing the account permissions status could cause confusion.

Contact support to request enablement of status checks on your tenant.

=== Using Onboarded Accounts

You can automatically create the required service accounts and roles in your cloud accounts to integrate Prisma Cloud with your cloud providers.

[.procedure]

. Log into Prisma Cloud.

. Go to *Settings > Cloud Accounts*.
+
image::credentials_store_prisma_cloud_oboarding.png[width=800]

. Complete the onboarding cloud account wizard to use the service accounts and roles when configuring Compute.
These accounts and roles are collectively called credentials.

. Before using a credential it needs to become read-only in Compute.
To find the surfaced credentials open the *Compute* tab. You can only update or delete credentials in *Settings > Cloud Accounts*.
Deleting surfaced credentials in the *Compute* tab credentials store only removes them from the table.

. Go to to the *Compute > Defend > Authentication* tab.

. Click *Add Credential*.

. In *Type*, select *Prisma Cloud*.

. Select all credentials you want to use.

. Click *Save*.

. You can use the credential in Compute to set up features like registry scanning.
