=== Overview

You can configure Microsegmentation Console to authenticate users against any https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect (OIDC)] identity provider.
Examples include https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[Google], https://developer.okta.com/[Okta], https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-openid-connect-code[Azure Active Directory], https://developer.yahoo.com/oauth2/guide/openid_connect/[Yahoo], https://auth0.com/[Auth0], and many others.

Integration with an OIDC identity provider gives your users single sign-on access to the Microsegmentation Console.


Microsegmentation uses the OIDC authorization code flow with a confidential client, [as described in the OIDC 1.0 specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth).

You can use [scopes](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) to request basic information about the user from the identity provider.
If the user consents to the requested scopes, the identity provider returns the information to Microsegmentation as claims in an [ID token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken).
The claims in the ID token allow you to control which users can gain access.

All identity providers should support the following list of scopes and claims.

- `profile` scope requests the following claims:
  - `name`
  - `family_name`
  - `given_name`
  - `middle_name`
  - `nickname`
  - `preferred_username`
  - `profile`
  - `picture`
  - `website`
  - `gender`
  - `birthdate`
  - `zoneinfo`
  - `locale`
  - `updated_at`

- `email` scope requests the following claims:
  -  `email`
  - `email_verified`

- `address` scope requests the `address` claim

- `phone` scope requests the following claims:
  - `phone_number`
  - `phone_number_verified`

Each identity provider supports additional scopes and claims.
Refer to the documentation of the identity provider to learn more.
Request only scopes that return claims as string, array, or boolean values.
Microsegmentation ignores other types of claim values.

NOTE: The OIDC sequence requires a browser and is not suitable for authenticating applications.

=== Before you begin

Familiarize yourself with the following sequence, particularly the bolded URLs.
Hover over the numbers for additional details.

Once the user obtains an Microsegmentation token containing the claims from the identity provider, they can use it to access:

* Microsegmentation Console web interface
* `apoctl`

Microsegmentation checks the policy you've defined against the claims in the Microsegmentation token to determine whether to allow the user access.

=== Adding Microsegmentation to the identity provider

While OIDC is a standard, each identity provider provides a different web interface.
This section guides you through the setup at a high level.

[NOTE]
====
Many identity providers orient their offerings towards developers. Good news! With Microsegmentation, you won't need to write any code to integrate with the identity provider.
====

* *Web application*: Identity providers often support a variety of application types.
If prompted, select web application.
* *Callback URLs*: Supply the identity provider with the following list of allowed callback URLs.
Identity providers sometimes refer to these as redirect URIs or login redirect URIs.
** `+https://<your-console-domain>/popup/oidc-verify+`: replace `<your-console-domain>` with the domain name of your Microsegmentation Console
** `+http://localhost:65332+`
* *Client ID and client secret*: The identity provider supplies a client ID and a client secret value.
These values allow Microsegmentation to communicate with the identity provider.
Store these values in a safe place.
You'll need them in subsequent procedures.
* *Scopes*: Though Microsegmentation sends the desired scopes in its request, some identity providers may ask you to identify the scopes during the configuration.
If so, supply the scopes to the identity provider.
For a detailed discussion of scopes, refer to <<_overview,the Overview>>.

[#_confirming-idp-discovery-endpoint]
=== Confirming the identity provider's discovery endpoint

Most identity providers offer a https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#IssuerDiscovery[discovery endpoint], although this is optional in the specification.
Microsegmentation requires the discovery endpoint.
Confirm that your identity provider supports it as follows.

[.procedure]
. Obtain the identity provider's URL. Your identity provider should make this value easy to obtain, but we provide some tips below.
+
|===
| Provider | Example | Discussion

| Auth0
| `+https://dev-bzp6k6-2.auth0.com/+`
| --

| Google
| `+https://accounts.google.com+`
| All clients use the same path.

| Microsoft Azure Active Directory
| `+https://sts.windows.net/cd629cb5-2826-4126-82fd-3f2df5f5bc7b/+`
| Append your https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365/How-do-you-find-the-tenant-ID/td-p/89018[tenant ID] to `+https://sts.windows.net/+`

| Okta
| `+https://dev-289699.okta.com/oauth2/default+`
| The base URL is the same as the path in your browser when you access your account, without the `-admin` string. For example, if I access my Okta account at `+https://dev-289699-admin.okta.com+`, my base URL is `+https://dev-289699.okta.com+`. Append `/oauth2` to the base URL. Then append the ID of your authorization server. If you have an Okta developer account, the ID is probably `/default`
|===

. Set an environment variable containing the identity provider's URL. An example follows. Replace `<identity-provider-url>` with the identity provider's URL before issuing the command.
+
[,console]
----
export IDP_URL=<identity-provider-url>
----

. Check if your identity provider supports the discovery endpoint by issuing the following command.
+
[,console]
----
curl $IDP_URL/.well-known/openid-configuration
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you don't have curl installed, try replacing `curl` with `wget`.
====

. Confirm that the command returns the JSON details of the identity provider's configuration.

[.task]
=== Adding the identity provider to Microsegmentation

[.procedure]
. In the Microsegmentation Console web interface, expand *Authentication Sources* and select *OIDC Providers*.

. Click the *Create* button to add a new identity provider.

. Type the name of the identity provider in the *Name* field.
+
[TIP]
====
If you have more than one identity provider, users must manually type this name to identify their identity provider. It is case sensitive.
====

. In the *Endpoint* field, add the identity provider's URL. If you completed the steps in <<_confirming-idp-discovery-endpoint,Confirming the identity provider's discovery endpoint>>, you can retrieve this value via `echo $IDP_URL`

. Paste the client secret in the *Client Secret* field and the client ID in the *Client ID* field.

. Type the requested scopes in the *Scopes* field, pressing ENTER after each one. At a minimum, you must have `openid`. If the identity provider supports refresh tokens and you would like to enable this feature, also include the `offline_access` scope. For more detail on scopes, refer to <<_overview,the Overview>>. These will allow you to identify the user and determine whether or not to authorize them.

. To set this as the default identity provider, select *Use this provider as the default*.
+
[WARNING]
====
We recommend setting at least one identity provider as the default.
====

. To add values of claims to the `subject` field of the Microsegmentation token, type the name of the scope in the *Subject* field, pressing ENTER after each one.
+
Examples follow.
+
|===
|Scope |Claim |Description

|`profile` | `family_name` | Adds the user's last name to the Microsegmentation token.
|`email` | `email` | Adds the user's email address to the Microsegmentation token.
|`groups`^1^ | `groups` | Adds the value for the `groups` claim to the Microsegmentation token. The type of value returned by the identity provider varies. Configure your identity provider to return an array or a string, as Microsegmentation ignores booleans.
|===
+
^1^ Not available from all identity providers.

. Click *Create*.

[.task]
=== Creating an API authorization

[.procedure]
. Expand *Namespace Settings*, click *Authorizations*, and click the *Create* button.

. Type a name for the policy.

. If you want the user to have access to all of the children of the current namespace, select *Propagate to child namespaces*.

. If you do not want this policy to be visible in the child namespaces, select *Hide propagation to child namespaces*.

. Type `@auth:realm=oidc` in the *Subject* field and press ENTER.
+
Then type the Microsegmentation tag that defines the value of the claim that must appear in the user's Microsegmentation token.
Some examples follow.
+
|===
|Identity provider | Scope requested | Example claim key or value | Microsegmentation tag

|all  | `email` | `+bjoliet@email.com+` | `+@auth:email=bjoliet@email.com+`
|https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#hd-param[Google] | `hd` | `example.com` | `@auth:hd=example.com`
|Microsoft Azure Active Directory | `groups`        | `groups:1e94a453-2727-47f6-b59e-d86df3494312` | `@auth:groups:1e94a453-2727-47f6-b59e-d86df3494312=true`
|Microsoft Azure Active Directory | `tid`           | `tid:9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad` | `@auth:tid:9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad=true`
|Okta                             | `groups`        | `groups:your-org` | `@auth:groups:your-org=true`
|===
+
[TIP]
====
You can include multiple tags connected by AND or OR to form a logical expression.
====

. Select the namespace that you want to allow the user to access from the *Target Namespace* list box.

. Click *Next*.

. If you want to require the user to attempt their login from a certain subnet or subnets, specify the subnet or subnets in the *List of authorized subnets* field.

. Click *Next*.

. Select the roles that the user should have.

. Click *Create*.

. Congratulations!
The user should now be able to click *Sign in with OIDC* to access the Microsegmentation Console web interface and use `apoctl auth oidc` to log into `apoctl`.
