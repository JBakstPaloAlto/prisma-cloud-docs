=== Create your Kubernetes cluster

Ensure that your target cluster meets the xref:reqs.adoc[system requirements].

[.task]
=== Configure kubectl

Set up your `kubeconfig` to point to the target cluster.

[.procedure]
. Retrieve the cluster credentials.
+
A couple of examples follow.
+
GKE
+
[,console]
----
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> \
--zone <region> --project <project>
----
+
EKS
+
[,console]
----
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <cluster-name>
----

. Check your `kubectl` context points to the correct Kubernetes cluster.
+
[,console]
----
kubectl get nodes
----

. Optionally, rename your Kubernetes context to something more meaningful:
+
[,console]
----
 kubectl config get-contexts
 kubectl config rename-context <current-context> <new-context>
----

. If you don't already have a namespace for the Microsegmentation Console, create one as follows.
+
[,console]
----
 kubectl create namespace microseg
----

[.task]
=== Set up Voila

[.procedure]
. From your Voila host, create a folder that will hold the Voila environment.
+
[,console]
----
 mkdir microseg
----

. Navigate into the directory.
+
[,console]
----
 cd microseg
----

. From your Voila host, pull the Voila container.
+
[,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
 docker pull {gcr-docker-next}/voila:{version-container}
----

[.task]
=== Start the Voila installer

[.procedure]
. Start the interactive install.
+
[,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
 docker run -ti \
   -v $PWD:/voila-env \
   -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube \
   {gcr-docker-next}/voila:{version-container} \
   create
----

. You will see a welcome message.

release-5.0.6 v1.515.1 (85f2120f)

================================================================================
Welcome to Voila. This tool will allow you to:
- create your voila environment
- deploy Aporeto using this voila environment

Please read carefuly and respond to the following questions.


What will be the public url of the API gateway?
----

. Provide the domain name or IP address that you want to use for your Microsegmentation Console API.
. Then provide the domain name of IP address that you want to use for the Microsegmentation Console web interface.
. Skip the URL of the documentation.
You must access the documentation on our public website at this time.
. Type `yes` for the monitoring setup, this is strongly recommended.
. Accept the default of `yes` for the scheduled snapshots.
You'll need to xref:../../maintain/backup.adoc[perform some setup to get them to work], but you can do this after installation.
. Accept the default registry of `{gcr-docker-next}` or set your own private registry if needed.
. Provide a name for your deployment or just accept the default.
. Either use the cluster your current context is pointing to, or provide an alternate.
. It should identify the correct Kubernetes context, you can press ENTER.
. At the prompt inquiring how to expose the Microsegmentation Console services, we strongly recommend typing `2` for load balancer.
+
[,console]
----
 How the public facing services will be exposed?
 1) node port
 2) load balancer
 3) ingress controller
 #? 2
----

. At the prompt that asks if you want to create your deployment, if you are not using custom certificates, type `yes`.
+
If you are using custom certificates, type `no`.
+
[,console]
----
 Your voila environment is now created.
 If you are satisfied with this configuration, you can deploy now.
 Otherwise a dry run will be performed and a summary displayed.

 Do you want to start the deployment? (y/n) default is yes: y
----

. Save the secret key in a safe place as directed.
+
The Voila environment contains all the secrets and certificates used by the Microsegmentation Console.
It is protected by a generated key that you must keep in a safe place.
Without this key you will *not* be able to load the environment again.
This key is only printed *once* at the end of the Voila environment creation process.
+
[,console]
----
 !!! Please remember to save the following shared key in a safe place. !!!
 !!! Don't lose it, or your voila environment will be locked forever.  !!!
 Key: AEdJVENSWVBUS0VZAAAAAgAAAAAAAAABAAAABAAAAAAAAAADAAAAIBImyzKjwCMSrjsuy6XbP8u59s5VLYZyWbjcO2xcyZ74AAAABQAAAEBjZYGZzorYp9MeOyr9dz/wXSRNYkyw8fe0rlfreUQXqOY7PS3vsmB54G6zlhqNkB0odlGTAVhWVwDyZ5Z6TslwAAAAAA==
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Ensure that you copy the key and paste it into a safe place.
Without this key you will not be able to load the environment again.
The key is only printed once at the end of the Voila environment creation process.
====

[.task]
=== Activate Voila

[.procedure]
. Activate Voila.
+
[,console]
----
 cd microseg && ./activate
----

. Provide the key at the prompt.
+
Your Voila environment is now active.
+
[NOTE]
====
To exit the environment, you can type either `CTRL+D` or `exit`.
====

[.task]
=== Add custom certificates (optional)

If you wish to use custom certificates, complete the following steps.

From within your activated Voila environment:

[.procedure]
. Copy your `public-ca.pem` to `/certs/public-ca.pem`  as:
+
[,console]
----
 mkdir -p /certs
 cp public-ca.pem > /certs/public-ca.pem
----

. Create the `/certs/public-cert.pem` file by concatenating the certificate and the chain.
The order matters.
The final `public-cert.pem` certificate must present the server certificate before the CA.
+
[,console]
----
 cat public-cert.pem public-ca.pem > /certs/public-cert.pem
----

. Copy your `public-key.pem` to `/certs/public-key.pem` as:
+
[,console]
----
 cat public-key.pem > /certs/public-key.pem
----
+
[NOTE]
====

The following files:

* `/certs/public-ca.pem`
* `/certs/public-cert.pem`
* `/certs/public-key.pem`

Will be securely integrated into the main configuration and will be deleted in the process.

To renew the certificate just repeat those steps and run `doit` to apply the changes.
====

=== Proceed with the installation

From the activated Voila environment just run:

[,console]
----
doit
----

This will configure the deployment with proper defaults values and proceed to the installation and perform some sanity checks at the end.

Example:
