Voila is a toolbox container that allows you to:

* Manage a Voila environment that wraps all your resources and targets a specific Kubernetes cluster.
* Prepares all the values and certificates that will be injected in the Helm charts to deploy the Microsegmentation Console.
* Secure your certificates and other secrets.
* Once activated, wraps Kubernetes and Helm commands to target your Kubernetes cluster.

Your Voila environment contains the following:

* `activate` script: activates your Voila environment
* `aporeto.yaml` file: contains all the settings used for the deployment
* `certs` folder: contains all generated certificates.
* `conf.d` folder: contains service configurations
* `conf.voila` file: contains the Voila settings

By default, `aporeto.yaml` and all certificates are encrypted when the environment is not activated.

A set of commands is available to perform administrative operations. See all commands available using:

[,console]
----
list-cmds
----

The main command is `doit`.
This a wrapper tool that will just do it with default configuration
This command will check your current setup and adapt the configuration, apply it and trigger the installation/upgrade if needed.
It is idempotent and is calling other commands under the hood like:

* `upconf`: This is the tool that maintain your environment settings up to date.
* `snap`: Is at tool that will analyze your current deployment and handle the install/update for you.
* `apostate`: To check the status of the current deployment

All the settings for your deployment are handled through YAML files that are then fed to the Helm charts to generate a Kubernetes resources to create.
There are two commands to help you read and write those configurations:

* `get_value`
* `set_value`

You may have the need to use Voila in a non-interactive way, for instance, to create a new Voila environment and deploy automatically.
Consult `docker run -ti {gcr-docker-next}/voila:{version-container} create -h` output to see what you can configure using environment variables.

To execute a command or a script against an existing Voila environment:

[,console]
----
export VOILA_ENV_KEY=<KEY>
cd ./microseg && ./activate run <cmd or script>
----

Where:

* `<KEY>` is the Voila environment key used to unlock it.
* `<cmd or script>` is a command or script containing commands to run.
