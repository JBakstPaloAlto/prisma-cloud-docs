Always conduct upgrades in sequence: first the Microsegmentation Console, then all `apoctl` clients, then the enforcers (optional).

After upgrading the Microsegmentation Console, you should upgrade all `apoctl` clients.
Otherwise, you may experience unexpected behavior.
The upgrade of `apoctl` consists of a simple xref:../start/install-apoctl.adoc[reinstall].

Never upgrade the enforcers without first upgrading the Microsegmentation Console.
Newer enforcers cannot communicate with older Microsegmentation Consoles.
Upgrading the enforcers is optional as older enforcers can continue to communicate with newer Microsegmentation Consoles.

Upgrading to 5.0 requires a one-time migration from network policies to network rulesets.
