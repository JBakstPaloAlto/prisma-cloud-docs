=== About adding Microsegmentation Consoles

To scale horizontally, you can deploy more than one Microsegmentation Console and configure them to trust each other.
In this section, we guide you through the process using two example Microsegmentation Consoles.

* Microsegmentation Console A, managed by `aoperator`, with the address `35.185.216.252`
* Microsegmentation Console B, managed by `boperator`, with the address `34.105.49.3`

`aoperator` and `boperator` both work for Acme, Inc.
Both Microsegmentation Consoles use `acme` as the account name and `/acme` as their root namespace.

=== Prerequisites

* At least two Prisma Cloud Compute (PCC) Consoles
* At least two Microsegmentation Consoles, bound to PCC Consoles
* At least one enforcer on each Microsegmentation Console--we'll refer to these as enforcer A and enforcer B
* Discovery mode disabled in the enforcer's namespaces
* Firewalls must allow pass-through communications and not modify any packets
* `apoctl` installed
* At least two app credentials with *Namespace administrator* privileges to the root namespace of each Microsegmentation Console--we'll refer to these as `app-cred-a` and `app-cred-b`

[.task]
=== Setting up test images

[.procedure]
. Access the enforcer A host, such as via SSH.

. Use the following command to spin up an nginx web server listening on any IP address over port 80.
+
[,console]
----
 sudo docker run --rm -d -p 80:80 nginx
----

. Open the web interface of Microsegmentation Console A and confirm that the web server shows up as a processing unit.

. Access the enforcer B host, such as via SSH.

. Use the following command to spin up a `centos` image.
+
[,console]
----
 sudo docker run -it centos
----

. Attempt to curl the nginx web server in Microsegmentation Console A, using `http` and the public IP address of the enforcer A host.
+
[,console]
----
 curl http://52.11.253.209
----

. It should time out after a while.
+
[,console]
----
 curl: (7) Failed to connect to 52.11.253.209 port 80: Connection timed out
----

. Open the web interface of Microsegmentation Console B and select *Platform*.
+
You should see the processing unit representing the `centos` image, but no record of the request.

. Open the web interface of Microsegmentation Console A and select *Platform*.
+
You should see the processing unit representing the `nginx` image.
When you click on it, you should see the record of the request under the *Access* tab, denied due to `token (The token was invalid.)`.
+

. While reviewing the `centos` and `nginx` details, observe the `$controller` tags in their metadata.

. Set a `CONSOLE_A` environment variable containing the `$controller` tag in the `nginx` metadata.
+
[,console]
----
 export CONSOLE_A='$controller=https://34.105.49.3:4443'
 echo $CONSOLE_A
----

. Set a `CONSOLE_B` environment variable containing the `$controller` tag in the `centos` metadata.
+
[,console]
----
 export CONSOLE_B='$controller=https://35.185.216.252:4443'
 echo $CONSOLE_B
----

[.task]
=== Configuring Microsegmentation Consoles to trust each other

[.procedure]
. Retrieve the certificate of the first Microsegmentation Console's certificate authority and save it to a `CERT_A` environment variable.
The following achieves this in a single command using https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[jq].
+
[,console]
----
 export CERT_A=$(apoctl api list trustedca --creds app-cred-a.json \
   | jq '.[] | .certificate' | sed 's/"//g')
 echo "$CERT_A"
----

. Retrieve the certificate of the second Microsegmentation Console's certificate authority and save it to a `CERT_B` environment variable.
+
[,console]
----
 export CERT_B=$(apoctl api list trustedca --creds app-cred-b.json \
   | jq '.[] | .certificate' | sed 's/"//g')
 echo "$CERT_B"
----

. Add the certificate of the first Microsegmentation Console to the second as trusted.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create trustednamespace --creds app-cred-b.json -f -
 name: Microsegmentation Console A
 certificateAuthority: "$CERT_A"
 EOF
----

. Add the certificate of the second Microsegmentation Console to the first as trusted.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create trustednamespace --creds app-cred-a.json -f -
 name: Microsegmentation Console B
 certificateAuthority: "$CERT_B"
 EOF
----

[.task]
=== Verifying the trusted relationship

[.procedure]
. Access the enforcer B host again.

. If you still have a shell inside the `centos` image, skip to the next step.
+
Otherwise, check if the `centos` image is still running.
+
[,console]
----
 sudo docker ps
----
+
If it is, you can `exec` into it: `sudo docker exec -it <image-id> /bin/bash`
If it's not running anymore, launch a new `centos` image.
+
[,console]
----
 sudo docker run -it centos
----

. From inside the `centos` container, attempt again to curl the nginx web server in Microsegmentation Console A.
+
[,console]
----
 curl http://52.11.253.209
----
+
It should time out again.
+
[,console]
----
 curl: (7) Failed to connect to 52.11.253.209 port 80: Connection timed out
----

. Open the web interface of Microsegmentation Console B and select *Platform*.
+
You should see the processing unit representing the `centos` image, but still no record of the request.

. Open the web interface of Microsegmentation Console A and select *Platform*.
+
You should now see a failed flow from Microsegmentation Console B to the `nginx` image.
Clicking for more details, you see that the reason for the denial was Microsegmentation's default deny policy.
+
image::fed-trust.gif[Replace me]
+
Your Microsegmentation Consoles now recognize and trust each other, but processing units in one cannot communicate with processing units in the other.
You must create network policies to allow this traffic.

[.task]
=== Allowing the Microsegmentation Consoles to communicate

In the following exercise, we create network policies in both Microsegmentation Consoles to allow our `centos` image to communicate with the `nginx` image.

[.procedure]
. Use the following command to create a network policy in the first Microsegmentation Console allowing communications.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkaccesspolicy --creds app-cred-a.json -f -
 name: allow-centos-in-b-to-nginx-in-a
 action: Allow
 applyPolicyMode: Bidirectional
 logsEnabled: true
 propagate: true
 subject:
 - - "$CONSOLE_B"
   - "\$image=centos"
 object:
 - - "$CONSOLE_A"
   - "\$image=nginx"
 EOF
----

. Use the following command to create a network policy in the second Microsegmentation Console allowing communications.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkaccesspolicy --creds app-cred-b.json -f -
 name: allow-centos-in-b-to-nginx-in-a
 action: Allow
 applyPolicyMode: Bidirectional
 logsEnabled: true
 propagate: true
 subject:
 - - "$CONSOLE_B"
   - "\$image=centos"
 object:
 - - "$CONSOLE_A"
   - "\$image=nginx"
 EOF
----

[.task]
=== Verifying the communications

[.procedure]
. Access the enforcer B host again.

. If necessary launch a new `centos` image.
+
[,console]
----
 sudo docker run -it centos
----

. From inside the `centos` container, attempt again to curl the nginx web server in Microsegmentation Console A.
+
[,console]
----
 curl http://54.65.32.1
----

. It should return the nginx welcome page.
+
[,console]

. Open the web interface of Microsegmentation Console B and select *Platform*.
+
You should see the processing unit representing the `centos` image, but still no record of the request.

. Open the web interface of Microsegmentation Console A and select *Platform*.

You should now see an allowed flow from Microsegmentation Console B to the `nginx` image.
Clicking for more details, you see that the policy you created was applied.

Great work!
You have established a trusted relationship between two Microsegmentation Consoles and allowed two processing units to communicate between consoles.
We hope you have learned enough to set additional network policies allowing the desired traffic.
